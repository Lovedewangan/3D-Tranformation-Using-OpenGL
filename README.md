# 3D Shape Transformation and Rendering Application
Overview
This is an interactive OpenGL-based application that allows users to manipulate 3D shapes through various transformations and camera controls. The project demonstrates advanced graphics programming techniques, including shape rendering, matrix transformations, and interactive user interfaces.

Features

3D Shapes
Render multiple 3D shapes:

Cube
Sphere
Pyramid
Cylinder

Transformation Modes
Supports comprehensive object transformations:

Translation
Rotation (X, Y, Z axes)
Scaling
Shearing
Reflection

Camera Controls

Free-look camera movement
First-person style camera navigation
Toggle between object manipulation and camera control

User Interface

Interactive buttons for shape and transformation selection
On-screen display of current transformation parameters
Real-time rendering updates

Technical Highlights

Uses OpenGL for rendering
Custom matrix transformation functions
Lighting and depth testing
Flexible camera system with mouse and keyboard controls
Advanced shape generation algorithms

Controls

Camera Mode (Toggle with 'c'):

WASD: Move
QE: Move up/down
Mouse: Look around
Spacebar: Reset camera

Object Transformation Mode:

WASD: Transform along different axes
QE: Additional transformation
Spacebar: Reset transformations

Requirements

OpenGL
GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)
